# Wide Microsoft Docs

Show Microsoft Docs Pages from [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com) with a maximized width.

# Installation

As a [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) or `UserCSS`:

This style can be installed into `Stylus`by going here: [wide-microsoft-docs.user.css]https://github.com/bergmeister/wide-microsoft-docs/blob/master/wide-microsoft-docs.user.css)

In the future, I might consider packing it as a Chrome extension and publishing it to the store.
